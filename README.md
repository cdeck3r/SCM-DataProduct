# SCM as a DataProduct

Services Computing is the science and engineering of IT-focused value creation for the digital business. The [Herman Hollerith Center (HHZ)](http://www.hhz.de) offers a scientifically ambitious masters programme on Services Computing (SCM). The [SCM Vision Board](http://www.hhz.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Hermann_Hollerith_Zentrum/Master/Services_Computing/SCMVisionBoard.jpg) provides a concise overview.

This student research project presents the [Services Computing masters programme (SCM)](http://www.hhz.de/master/services-computing/) as data product. 

The [project wiki](https://github.com/cdeck3r/SCM-DataProduct/wiki) documents the progress.
